This is a text-based haunted house game written by Noah Schoonover.
It is inspired by the Haunted House text game for the TRS-80.

HOW TO PLAY
For this version, you have to have Python 3+ installed. 
www.python.org
Run the game by double clicking 'game.py'.
I plan to make a version that runs from an exe file.

Type "HELP" in game for the basic commads.

I recommend running from the python exe window for the white on black (not IDLE).
I also recommend playing with caps-lock on, but commands will work regardless.
